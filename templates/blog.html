    <h1 style="color:#2C3333;">Convert text to morse code in python</h1>
    <h6>What is the morse alphabet?</h6>
    <p> Morse alphabet is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones,
        lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener
        or observer without special equipment.
        It is named for Samuel F. B. Morse, an inventor of the telegraph.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="static/assets/imgs/morse_alp.jpg" class="responsive">
    <hr>

    <h6>Encryption </h6>
    <p>~In the case of encryption, we extract each character from a word one at a time and match it with its
        corresponding morse code stored in whichever data structure we have chosen.<br>
        ~Store the morse code in a variable that will contain the encoded string and then we add a space to our string
        that will contain the result.<br>
        ~While encoding in morse code we need to add 1 space between every character and 2 consecutive spaces between
        every word.<br>
        ~If the character is a space then add another space to the variable containing the result.
        We repeat this process till we traverse the whole string </p>
    <hr>
    <h5>Allright! let's start coding!</h5>
    <p> First. We need dictionary takes english alphabets as keys and morse alphabets as value</p>
    <pre><code> alphabet={
  'A': ".-", 'B': "-...", 'C': "-.-.", 'D': "-..",'E': ".", 'F': "..-.",'G': "--.",
  'H': "....",'I': "..", 'J': ".---", 'K': "-.-",'L': ".-..", 'M': "--", 'N': "-.",
  'O': "---", 'P': ".--.", 'Q': "--.-",,'R': ".-.", 'S': "...", 'T': "-", 'U': "..-",
  'V': "...-",'W': ".--", 'X': "-..-", 'Y': "-.--", 'Z': "--..",}
           </code></pre>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>Then, we must ask user what word they want to encrypt. We should separate characters in strings and append them
        to the list.
        Now, we have to capitalize all character.</p>

    <pre><code>    ask_user = input("Which word do you wanna encrypt:")
    word_list =list>(ask_user)
    morse_code=[]
    for in word_list:
         morse_code.append(alphabet[f'{l. class="func">capitalize()}'])</code></pre>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <p>Finally, we can take every character's value (morse alphabets) in dictionary and replace them with english
        alphabets. </p>
    <pre><code>    x_string= ''.join(map(str, morse_code))
    print(x_string)
</code></pre>
    <h5> Here is the full code:</h5>
    <pre><code> alphabet={
  'A': ".-", 'B': "-...", 'C': "-.-.", 'D': "-..",'E': ".", 'F': "..-.",'G': "--.",
  'H': "....",'I': "..", 'J': ".---", 'K': "-.-",'L': ".-..", 'M': "--", 'N': "-.",
  'O': "---", 'P': ".--.", 'Q': "--.-",,'R': ".-.", 'S': "...", 'T': "-", 'U': "..-",
  'V': "...-",'W': ".--", 'X': "-..-", 'Y': "-.--", 'Z': "--..",}

  ask_user = input("Which word do you wanna encrypt:")
  word_list =list>(ask_user)
  morse_code=[]
  for in word_list:
      morse_code.append(alphabet[f'{l. class="func">capitalize()}'])

  x_string= ''.join(map(str, morse_code))
  print(x_string)

        <h1>Artificial Intelligences (AI) are the next big thing</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just a concept we see in Hollywood movies. It has permeated every
            aspect of our lives, from the way we shop to the way we work. AI is changing the way we live and work, and
            there is no denying its impact on our society.
            <br>
            AI is the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual
            perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. Through machine learning, AI
            systems can improve their performance over time as they analyze data and learn from the results.
            <br>
            One of the most exciting applications of AI is in healthcare. AI is being used to assist doctors in making
            more accurate diagnoses, predicting disease outbreaks, and even developing new treatments. AI algorithms are
            being trained to analyze large amounts of patient data and identify patterns that human experts might miss.
            <br>
            In the finance industry, AI is being used to develop smarter investment strategies, identify fraud, and
            streamline processes. AI is also being used in customer service, where chatbots can provide instant support
            to customers 24/7. AI-powered virtual assistants, like Siri and Alexa, are becoming more and more popular as
            they help people manage their daily lives.
            <br>
            However, there are also concerns about the impact of AI on jobs, privacy, and security. As machines become
            more intelligent, they may replace human workers in certain industries. There are also concerns about data
            privacy and security, as AI algorithms require large amounts of data to be trained.
            <br>
            Despite these concerns, the potential benefits of AI are hard to ignore. AI has the power to transform
            industries, boost productivity, and improve people's lives. As we continue to develop and refine AI
            technology, it's important that we also address these concerns to ensure that AI is used ethically and
            responsibly.
            <br>
            In conclusion, AI is shaping our world in ways we never thought possible. From healthcare to finance, AI is
            transforming industries and changing the way we live and work. While there are concerns about the impact of
            AI, the potential benefits are too great to ignore. We must continue to develop AI technology ethically and
            responsibly to ensure a better future for all. (By the way, this blog is also writen by Ai )</p>

        <h1>What is Texture in Web Design & Why is it so Important?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Texture, or the appearance of elements on a webpage, has become highly influential for web design. Not only
            does texture add more visual interest and creativity to a website, but it also informs the user's
            experience. For example, a website with neutral colors and minimalistic textures may look more professional
            and clean whereas one with vivid colors and textures may look more playful and inviting. Texture is an
            important element for any web designer because it helps create an identity for the website as well as
            increasing engagement. Textures can be used in conjunction with textual elements like headlines, titles,
            call-to-actions to create the perfect harmony between written words and graphical visuals which translates
            into a better overall engagement by giving users a richer experience. It adds a sense of realism and depth
            to a website and helps create an emotional connection between the visitor and the content on the website.
            Texture in web design can be achieved through the use of images, fonts, shapes, and other visuals. Textures
            can also be used to create interesting layouts which help enhance user experience. By combining different
            textures with different writing styles, it enables web designers to create visually appealing designs that
            evoke emotions from website visitors. Therefore, texture plays an essential role in making web design
            engaging and successful.</p>
        <br>
        <h6>Categories of texture</h6>
        <p> There are three categories of texture: tactile, visual, and audible. Tactile texture is the feel of a
            material to human touch. Visual texture affects how an object or room looks, and audible texture affects how
            the object or room sounds. Depending on the surfaces of materials used, sounds in a room can be amplified
            (made louder) or dampened (made softer). Audible texture also refers to how a surface sounds when rubbed.
            Touch texture!</p>

        <br>
        <h1>Blockchain</h1>
        <h6>How blockchain works?</h6>
        <p>Blockchain is a distributed and decentralized digital ledger that keeps a record of all transactions made on
            a network. It works through a consensus mechanism, where nodes on the network validate transactions and add
            them to the blockchain.
            <br>
            Here are the steps of how blockchain works:
            <br>
            1. A transaction is initiated and broadcast to the nodes on the network. The transaction contains
            information such as the sender, receiver, and amount.
            <br>
            2. The nodes on the network validate the transaction using a consensus mechanism. Depending on the
            blockchain, this can be proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, or other consensus mechanisms.
            <br>
            3. Once the transaction is validated, it is added to a block, which includes a unique code called a hash.
            <br>
            4. The block is then broadcast to the network and added to the blockchain. Each block contains the hash of
            the previous block, creating a chain of blocks, hence the name blockchain.
            <br>
            5. The blockchain is then distributed to all the nodes on the network, creating a decentralized ledger that
            everyone can see.
            <br>
            6. Once a block is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed. If someone wants to change a transaction,
            they would have to change all the blocks in the chain, which is extremely difficult and almost impossible.
            This makes the blockchain extremely secure.
            <br>
        </p>
        <h6>Usage of blockchain</h6>
        <p>Blockchain technology has numerous use cases across various industries. Here are some of the most common use
            cases of blockchain:
            <br>
            1. Cryptocurrencies: The most well-known use case of blockchain is cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and
            other digital currencies use blockchain technology to store transactions and ensure their security.
            <br>
            2. Supply Chain Management: Blockchain can be used to track products and materials across the supply chain,
            ensuring transparency and eliminating fraud.
            <br>
            3. Identity Management: Blockchain can be used to create secure, decentralized identity management systems
            that protect personal data and prevent identity theft.
            <br>
            4. Voting Systems: Blockchain can be used to create secure and transparent voting systems that are resistant
            to hacking and fraud.
            <br>
            5. Smart Contracts: Blockchain can be used to create self-executing contracts that automatically execute
            when certain conditions are met.
            <br>
            6. Health Records: Blockchain can be used to securely store and share health records, improving patient
            privacy and reducing medical fraud.
            <br>
            7. Real Estate: Blockchain can be used to streamline and digitize the real estate transaction process,
            ensuring transparency and reducing fraud.
            <br>
            8. Digital Rights: Blockchain can be used to protect and manage digital rights for music, movies, and other
            forms of intellectual property.
            <br>
        </p>
        <h6>Conclusion:</h6>
        <p>
            Overall, blockchain is an innovative technology that provides a secure and transparent way of recording and
            storing transactions, without the need for intermediaries. It has the potential to transform various
            industries, including finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.

        <h1>Responsive website</h1>
        <h6>What is responsive website</h6>
        <p>A responsive website is a website that is designed and developed to adapt to various screen sizes and
            devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. This means that the website is able to adjust
            its layout, content, and features to provide the best possible user experience regardless of the device
            being used. Responsive websites are typically built using a combination of fluid grid layouts, flexible
            images, and media queries that allow the site to respond to the size and orientation of the user's screen.
            This ensures that the website looks and functions correctly on any device, increasing its usability and
            accessibility for all users.</p>
        <h6>It's importance</h6>
        <p>The importance of responsive website design can be summed up in three main points:
            <br>
            1. Mobile usage is increasing: With the increasing usage of mobile devices, it has become necessary for
            websites to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. A responsive website ensures that your website
            looks great and functions well on any device, including smartphones and tablets.
            <br>
            2. Better user experience: Responsive design ensures that users can easily navigate and interact with your
            website, which leads to a better user experience. A positive user experience increases the likelihood that
            users will stay on your site longer, engage with your content, and ultimately convert into customers.
            <br>
            3. Improved SEO: Google and other search engines prioritize responsive websites. By having a responsive
            design, your website will have a better chance of ranking higher in search engine results pages (SERPs).
            This is because responsive websites have a single URL and the same HTML code, which makes it easier for
            search engines to crawl and index.
            <br>
